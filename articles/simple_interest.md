# Simple Interest

## What is Simple Interest?

- **Simple Interest (SI)** is the amount paid for borrowing money, calculated on the original principal, for a specified time at a specified rate.
- It is calculated without compounding.

**Key Terms:**
- **Principal (P)**: The amount borrowed or invested.
- **Rate of Interest (R%)**: Percentage of interest per year.
- **Time (T)**: Time period in years.
- **Amount (A)**: Total money = Principal + Interest.

---

## Basic Formula

Simple Interest (SI) is calculated as:

```
SI = (P × R × T) / 100
```

Amount (A) is:

```
A = P + SI
```

**Example:**
- Find the simple interest and amount on ₹16,000 at 15% per annum for 3 years.
  
  ```
  SI = (16000 × 15 × 3) / 100 = ₹7200
  Amount = 16000 + 7200 = ₹23200
  ```

## Important Concepts

### 1. Time and Rate Relationship

If a sum becomes **n times** itself in T years on simple interest:

- **Rate (R%)** = `[(n - 1) × 100] / T`
- **Time (T)** = `[(n - 1) × 100] / R`

**Example:**
- A sum becomes 3 times in 4 years.  
  Find the rate:
  
  ```
  R% = (3 - 1) × 100 / 4 = 50%
  ```

---

### 2. Sum Doubling or Multiplying

If a sum **doubles** in 7 years at simple interest:

- It means the interest is equal to the principal.
- For becoming **5 times**, it would take:

  ```
  4 × 7 = 28 years
  ```

**Example:**
- A sum doubles in 7 years. Find time to become 5 times:  
  ```
  Time = 4 × 7 = 28 years
  ```

---

### 3. Ratio of Principal and Amount

If SI for 10 years at 5% per annum is ₹2000:

- Principal = 100%,  
- SI = (10 × 5)% = 50%
- Thus, Principal : Amount = 100% : 150% = **2 : 3**

**Example:**
- Find the ratio of principal to amount:

  ```
  P : A = 2 : 3
  ```

---

### 4. Finding Principal and Rate from Amounts

When the difference in amount over different times is known:

- Use the change to find SI, Principal, and Rate.

**Example:**
- A sum amounts to ₹6076 in 1 year and ₹7504 in 4 years.

  Step 1:  
  ```
  3 years SI = 7504 - 6076 = ₹1428
  1 year SI = 1428 ÷ 3 = ₹476
  ```

  Step 2:  
  ```
  Principal = 6076 - 476 = ₹5600
  ```

  Step 3:
  ```
  Rate = (476 × 100) / 5600 = 8.5%
  ```

### 5. Simple Interest on Different Rates over Time

If different rates apply over different time periods:

**Formula:**
```
Total SI = (Sum × Rate1 × Time1) / 100 + (Sum × Rate2 × Time2) / 100 + (Sum × Rate3 × Time3) / 100
```

**Example:**
- A sum lent at 4% for 3 years, 8% for next 4 years, and 12% thereafter.  
  If SI for 11 years = ₹27,600:

  ```
  Total % = (4 × 3) + (8 × 4) + (12 × 4) = 92%
  Sum = (27600 × 100) / 92 = ₹30,000
  ```

---

### 6. Concept of Equal Simple Interests

If different parts of an amount earn **equal simple interest**:

**Example:**
- ₹9000 split into three parts at 3%, 4%, and 6%.

  Since interests are equal:

  ```
  Ratio of Investments = Inverse of Rates = 4 : 3 : 2
  ```

  Investment at 6%:
  ```
  = (2 / 9) × 9000 = ₹2000
  ```

---

### 7. Installment Concept in Simple Interest

If a loan is cleared in equal installments:

- Break down into units considering interest accumulation on each installment.

**Example:**
- Due amount = ₹30,000, Rate = 8% p.a., Time = 4 years.

Total units = 100 + 108 + 116 + 124 = 448 units.

If 448 units = ₹39,600,  
then:

```
Value of each installment = 39600 ÷ 448 ≈ ₹88.39
```

---

## Summary

- **Simple Interest** is straightforward and linear.
- Useful for problems involving **doubling, tripling sums**, and **installments**.
- **Key formula**: `SI = (P × R × T) / 100`
- Always **read carefully** when multiple rates or periods are involved.
